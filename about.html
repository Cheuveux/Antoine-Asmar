                    <p>Since 1986, ANTOINE ASMAR has embodied a distinct and personal architectural vision, driven by emotion, intuition, and elegance — a signature style known as the “Coup de Cœur”.</p>

                    <p>Trained between Lebanon, Italy, and France, the founder’s journey bridges Mediterranean sensitivity with European rigour. A graduate in Architecture from USEK (1987), she enriched her approach with a specialization at Politecnico di Torino (1990), followed by her DPLG qualification from Paris La Villette (1999), and a DEA at the Sorbonne focused on Gardens, Territories, and Landscapes (2000).</p>

                    <p>Her career began in 1983 at the renowned design office NETLINE, where she led major projects across office buildings, banks, residential apartments, and custom furniture design. In 1992, she fully launched her independent practice in France.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                      Since 2004, she has developed a unique expertise in spa and wellness design, crafting environments that evoke serenity, balance, and sensory harmony. Her spaces are immersive, human-centered, and always tailored — a place where “you feel at ease and serene.”  
                    </p>

                    <p>
                       With over three decades of experience, she continues to lead ANTOINE ASMAR with passion, creativity, and a profound respect for the spirit of place.
